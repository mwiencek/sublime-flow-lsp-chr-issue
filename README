Sublime Text (build 4107) LSP breaks Flow if there's a non-ASCII
character present in the source code. VSCode works fine.

1. Install LSP-Flow
2. Run yarn in this repo to install flow-bin
2. Open chr-issue.sublime-project / index.js
3. If LSP is configured correctly, you'll get a message that flow exited with status 1

See log-panel.txt for the debug output.
